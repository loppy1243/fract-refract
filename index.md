# Welcome!

This site is very much a work-in-progress,
  but having something is better than nothing!

On the top right, you'll find links to
* A blog.
  This is about whatever I want it to be,
    most often math,
    sometimes programming,
    and every now-and-again whatever catches my whim.
* Notation/definitions.
  This contains all the notation and definitions (mathematical or otherwise)
    used in other pages that I feel need clarification.
* Miscellaneous.
  Here I've just dumped a bunch of stuff I've wrote,
    mostly notes and solutions to exercises from books,
    but other musings as well.
  A lot of this is probably not fit for consumption,
    and I plan to turn many of the ideas and concepts into blog posts.
