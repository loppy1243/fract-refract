# Notation and Definitions

## Geometric/Clifford algebra
* $A \lc B$ and $A \rc B$.
  These are, respectively, the left and right contractions,
    which are a much more natural and intuitive way
    of handling metric operations
    as opposed to using some sort of symmetric dot product.

  See \cite{Dorst 2002}.
* $A * B = \langle AB\rangle_0,$ the scalar part of the geometric product.
* $A \subseteq B.$
  This means that $x \meet A = 0$ implies $x \meet B = 0$ for all vectors $x$.
  This makes the most sense for blades,
    since they more clearly represent particular subspaces.
